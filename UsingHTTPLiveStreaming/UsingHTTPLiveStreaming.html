The tools include a media stream segmenter, a media file segmenter, a stream validator, and a variant playlist generator.</p><p>The tools are included with Mac OS X, version 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and later. They can be found in the <code>/usr/bin/</code> directory. This directory is hidden from the finder, but is accessible from the Terminal application.</p><p>The tools are frequently updated, so you should download the current version of the HTTP Live Streaming Tools from the Apple Developer website. You can access them if you are a member of either the iPhone or Mac Developer Program. One way to navigate to the tools is to log onto <code>connect.apple.com</code>, then click either iPhone or QuickTime under the Downloads heading.</p><section><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008332-CH102-DontLinkElementID_11" title="Media Stream Segmenter"></a><h3 class="jump">Media Stream Segmenter</h3><p>The <code>mediastreamsegmenter</code> command-line tool takes an MPEG-2 transport stream as an input and produces a series of equal-length files from it, suitable for use in HTTP Live Streaming. It can also generate index files, encrypt the media, produce encryption keys, optimize the files by reducing overhead, and create the necessary files for automatically generating multiple stream alternates. For details, type <code>man mediastreamsegmenter</code> from the terminal window.</p></section><section><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008332-CH102-DontLinkElementID_12" title="Media File Segmenter"></a><h3 class="jump">Media File Segmenter</h3><p>The <code>mediafilesegmenter</code> command-line tool takes an encoded media file as an input, wraps it in an MPEG-2 transport stream (unless it is already encapsulated in one), and produces a series of equal-length files from it, suitable for use in HTTP Live Streaming. The file stream segmenter behaves very much like the media stream segmenter, but it works on existing files instead of streams coming from an encoder. For details, type <code>man mediafilesegmenter</code> from the terminal window.</p></section><section><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008332-CH102-DontLinkElementID_13" title="Media Stream Validator"></a><h3 class="jump">Media Stream Validator</h3><p>The <code>mediastreamvalidator</code> command-line tool examines the index files, stream alternates, and media segment files on a server and tests to determine whether they will work with HTTP Live Streaming clients. For details, type <code>man mediastreamvalidator</code> from the terminal window.</p></section><section><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008332-CH102-DontLinkElementID_14" title="Varient Playlist Creator"></a><h3 class="jump">Varient Playlist Creator</h3><p>The <code>variantplaylistcreator</code> command-line tool creates index files, or playlists, for alternate streams from the output of the media stream segmenter (the media stream segmenter must be invoked with the <code>-generate-variant-info </code>argument to produce the required output for the playlist creator). For details, type <code>man varientplaylistcreator </code>from the terminal window.</p></section><section><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008332-CH102-DontLinkElementID_15" title="Metadata Tag Generator"></a><h3 class="jump">Metadata Tag Generator</h3><p>The <code>id3taggenerator</code> command-line tool generates ID3 metadata tags. These tags can either be written to a file or inserted into outgoing stream segments. For details, see <span class="content_text"><a href="#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008332-CH102-SW4">“Adding Metadata.”</a></span></p></section></section><section><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008332-CH102-DontLinkElementID_16" title="Session Types"></a><h2 class="jump">Session Types</h2><p>The HTTP Live Streaming protocol supports live broadcast sessions and video on demand (VOD) sessions.</p><p>For live sessions, as new media files are created and made available the index file is updated. The new index file includes the new media files; older files are typically removed.  The updated index file presents a moving window into a continuous stream. This type of session is suitable for continuous broadcasts.</p><p>For VOD sessions, media files are available representing the entire duration of the presentation. The index file is static and contains a complete list of all files created since the beginning of the presentation.  This kind of session allows the client full access to the entire program.  </p><p>It is possible to create a live broadcast of an event that is instantly available for video on demand. To convert a live broadcast to VOD, do not remove the old media files from the server or delete their URLs from the index file, and add an <code>#EXT-X-ENDLIST</code> tag to the index when the broadcast ends. This allows clients to join the broadcast late and still see the entire event. It also allows an event to be archived for rebroadcast with no additional time or effort.</p><p>VOD can also be used to deliver “canned” media. It is typically more efficient to deliver such media as a single QuickTime movie or MPEG-4 file, but HTTP Live Streaming offers some advantages, such as support for media encryption and dynamic switching between streams of different data rates in response to changing connection speeds. (QuickTime also supports multiple-data-rate movies using progressive download, but QuickTime movies do not support dynamically switching between data rates in mid-movie.)</p></section><section><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008332-CH102-DontLinkElementID_17" title="Content Protection"></a><h2 class="jump">Content Protection</h2><p>Media files containing stream segments may be individually encrypted.  When encryption is employed, references to the corresponding key files appear in the index file so that the client can retrieve the keys for decryption.  </p><p>When a key file is listed in the index file, the key file contains a cipher key that must be used to decrypt subsequent media files listed in the index file.  Currently HTTP Live Streaming supports AES-128 encryption using 16-octet keys. The format of the key file is a packed array of these 16 octets in binary format.</p><p>The media stream segmenter available from Apple provides encryption and supports three modes for configuring encryption.  </p><p>The first mode allows you to specify a path to an existing key file on disk.  In this mode the segmenter inserts the URL of the existing key file in the index file. It encrypts all media files using this key.</p><p>The second mode instructs the segmenter to generate a random key file, save it in a specified location, and reference it in the index file. All media files are encrypted using this randomly generated key.</p><p>The third mode instructs the segmenter to generate a random key file, save it in a specified location, reference it in the index file, and then regenerate and reference a new key file every <em>n</em> files.  This mode is referred to as key rotation. Each group of <em>n</em> files is encrypted using a different key.</p><div class="notebox"><aside><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008332-CH102-DontLinkElementID_35" title="Note"></a><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;All media files may be encrypted using the same key, or new keys may be required at intervals. The theoretical limit is one key per media file, but because each media key adds a file request and transfer to the overhead for presenting the following media segments, changing to a new key periodically is less likely to impact system performance than changing keys for each segment.</p><p></p></aside></div><p>You can serve key files using either HTTP or HTTPS.  You may also choose to protect the delivery of the key files using your own session-based authentication scheme.</p></section><section><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008332-CH102-DontLinkElementID_18" title="Caching and Delivery Protocols"></a><h2 class="jump">Caching and Delivery Protocols</h2><p>HTTPS is commonly used to deliver key files. It may also be used to deliver the content files and index files, but this is not recommended when scalability is important, since HTTPS requests often bypass web server caches, causing all content requests to be routed through your server and defeating the purpose of edge network distribution systems.</p><p>For this very reason, however, it is important to make sure that any content delivery network you use understands that the <code>.M3U8</code> index files are not to be cached for longer than one media segment duration.</p></section><section><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008332-CH102-DontLinkElementID_19" title="Stream Alternates"></a><h2 class="jump">Stream Alternates</h2><p>Index files may reference alternate streams of content.  References can be used to support delivery of multiple streams of the same content with varying quality levels for different bandwidths or devices.  HTTP Live Streaming supports switching between streams dynamically if the available bandwidth changes. The client software uses heuristics to determine appropriate times to switch between the alternates.  Currently, these heuristics are based on recent trends in measured network throughput.</p><p>The index file points to alternate streams of media by including a specially tagged list of other index files, as illustrated in <span class="content_text">Figure 2-1</span></p><figure><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008332-CH102-SW2" title="Figure 2-1Stream alternates"></a><figcaption><strong>Figure 2-1&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Stream alternates</figcaption><img src="../art/indexing.jpg" alt="" width="294" height="283"></figure><p>Note that the client may choose to change to an alternate stream at any time, such as when a mobile device enters or leaves a WiFi hotspot. All alternates should use identical audio to allow smooth transitions among streams.</p></section><section><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008332-CH102-DontLinkElementID_20" title="Video Over Cellular Networks"></a><h2 class="jump">Video Over Cellular Networks</h2><p>When you send video to a mobile device such as iPhone or iPad, the client’s Internet connection may move to or from a cellular network at any time.</p><p>HTTP Live Streaming allows the client to choose among stream alternates dynamically as the network bandwidth changes, providing the best stream as the device moves between cellular and WiFi connections, for example, or between 3G and EDGE connections. This is a significant advantage over progressive download.</p><p>It is strongly recommended that you use HTTP Live Streaming to deliver video to all cellular-capable devices, even for video on demand, so that your viewers have the best experience possible under changing conditions.</p><p>In addition, you should provide cellular-capable clients an alternate stream at 64 Kbps or less for slower data connections. If you cannot provide video of acceptable quality at 64 Kbps or lower, you should provide an audio-only stream, or audio with a still image.</p></section><section><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008332-CH102-DontLinkElementID_21" title="Requirements for Apps"></a><h2 class="jump">Requirements for Apps</h2><div class="warningbox clear"><aside><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008332-CH102-DontLinkElementID_36" title="Warning:"></a><p><strong>Warning:</strong>&nbsp;Apps submitted for distribution in the App Store must conform to these requirements.</p><p></p><div class="clear"></div></div></aside><p>If your app delivers video over cellular networks, and the video exceeds either 10 minutes duration or 5 MB of data in a five minute period, you are required to use HTTP Live Streaming. (Progressive download may be used for smaller clips.)</p><p>If your app uses HTTP Live Streaming over cellular networks, you are required to provide at least one stream at 64 Kbps or lower bandwidth (the low-bandwidth stream may be audio-only or audio with a still image).</p><p>These requirements apply to apps submitted for distribution in the App Store for use on Apple products. Non-compliant apps may be rejected or removed, at the discretion of Apple.</p></section><section><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008332-CH102-DontLinkElementID_22" title="Failover Protection"></a><h2 class="jump">Failover Protection</h2><p>If your playlist contains alternate streams, they can not only operate as bandwidth or device alternates, but as failure fallbacks. Starting with iOS 3.1, if the client is unable to reload the index file for a stream (due to a 404 error, for example), the client attempts to switch to an alternate stream.</p><p>In the event of an index load failure on one stream, the client chooses the highest bandwidth alternate stream that the network connection supports. If there are multiple alternates at the same bandwidth, the client chooses among them in the order listed in the playlist.</p><p>You can use this feature to provide redundant streams that will allow media to reach clients even in the event of severe local failures, such as a server crashing or a content distributor node going down.</p><p>To implement failover protection, create a stream, or multiple alternate bandwidth streams, and generate a playlist file as you normally would. Then create a parallel stream, or set of streams, on a separate server or content distribution service. Add the list of backup streams to the playlist file, so that the backup stream at each bandwidth is listed after the primary stream. For example, if the primary stream comes from server ALPHA, and the backup stream is on server BETA, your playlist file might look something like this:</p><div class="codesample clear"><table><tr><td scope="row"><pre>#EXTM3U<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:PROGRAM-ID=1, BANDWIDTH=200000<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>http://ALPHA.mycompany.com/lo/prog_index.m3u8<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:PROGRAM-ID=1, BANDWIDTH=200000<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>http://BETA.mycompany.com/lo/prog_index.m3u8<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre> <span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:PROGRAM-ID=1, BANDWIDTH=500000<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>http://ALPHA.mycompany.com/md/prog_index.m3u8<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:PROGRAM-ID=1, BANDWIDTH=500000<span></span></pre></td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><pre>http://BETA.mycompany.com/md/prog_index.m3u8<span></span></pre></td></tr></table></div><p>Note that the backup streams are intermixed with the primary streams in the playlist, with the backup at each bandwidth listed after the primary for that bandwidth.</p><p>You are not limited to a single backup stream set. In the example above, ALPHA and BETA could be followed by GAMMA, for instance. Similarly, you need not provide a complete parallel set of streams. You could provide a single low-bandwidth stream on a backup server, for example.</p></section><section><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008332-CH102-SW4" title="Adding Metadata"></a><h2 class="jump">Adding Metadata</h2><p>You can add various kinds of metadata to media stream segments. For example, you can add the album art, artist’s name, and song title to an audio stream. As another example, you could add the current batter’s name and statistics to video of a baseball game. Metadata can be a file in ID3 format or an image file (JPEG or PNG).</p><p>If an audio-only stream includes an image as metadata, the Apple client software automatically displays it. Currently, the only metadata that is automatically displayed by the Apple-supplied client software is a still image accompanying an audio-only stream.</p><p>If you are writing your own client software, however, using either <code>MPMoviePlayerController</code> or <code>AVPlayerItem</code>, you can access streamed metadata using the <code>timedMetaData</code> property.</p><p>You can add metadata by specifying a metadata file in the <code>-F</code> command line option to either the stream segmenter or the file segmenter. Metadata specified this way is automatically inserted into every media segment.</p><p>You can also add <em>timed</em> metadata, which is inserted into a media stream at a given time offset. Timed metadata can optionally be inserted into all segments after a given time.</p><p>To add timed metadata to a live stream, use the <code>id3taggenerator</code> tool, with its output set to the stream segmenter. The tool generates ID3 metadata and passes it the stream segmenter for inclusion in the outbound stream.</p><p>The tag generator can be run from a shell script, for example, to insert metadata at the desired time, or at desired intervals. New timed metadata automatically replaces any existing metadata.</p><p>Once metadata has been inserted into a media segment, it is persistent. If a live broadcast is re-purposed as video on demand, for example, it retains any metadata inserted during the original broadcast.</p><p>Adding timed metadata to a stream created using the file segmenter is slightly more complicated. </p><ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p>First, generate the metadata samples. You can generate ID3 metadata using the <code>id3taggenerator</code> command-line tool, with the output set to file.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Next, create a <strong>metadata macro file</strong>—a text file in which each line contains the time to insert the metadata, the type of metadata, and the path and filename of a metadata file. </p><p>For example, the following metadata macro file would insert a picture at 1.2 seconds into the stream, then an ID3 tag at 10 seconds:</p><p><code>1.2 picture /meta/images/picture.jpg</code></p><p><code>10 id3 /meta/id3/title.id3</code></p></li><li class="li"><p>Finally, specify the metadata macro file by name when you invoke the media file segmenter, using the <code>-M</code> command line option.</p></li></ol><p>For additional details, see the <code>man</code> pages for <code>mediastreamsegmenter</code>, <code>mediafilesegmenter</code>, and <code>id3taggenerator</code>.</p></section><section><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008332-CH102-DontLinkElementID_23" title="Sample Streams"></a><h2 class="jump">Sample Streams</h2><p>There are a series of HTTP streams available for testing on Apple’s developer site. These examples show proper formatting of HTML to embed streams, <code>.M3U8</code> files to index the streams, and <code>.ts</code> media segment files. The streams can be accessed at the following URLs:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p><span class="content_text"><a href="http://devimages.apple.com/iphone/samples/bipbopgear1.html" class="urlLink" rel="external">http://devimages.apple.com/iphone/samples/bipbopgear1.html</a></span></p></li><li class="li"><p><span class="content_text"><a href="http://devimages.apple.com/iphone/samples/bipbopgear2.html" class="urlLink" rel="external">http://devimages.apple.com/iphone/samples/bipbopgear2.html</a></span></p></li><li class="li"><p><span class="content_text"><a href="http://devimages.apple.com/iphone/samples/bipbopgear3.html" class="urlLink" rel="external">http://devimages.apple.com/iphone/samples/bipbopgear3.html</a></span></p></li><li class="li"><p><span class="content_text"><a href="http://devimages.apple.com/iphone/samples/bipbopgear4.html" class="urlLink" rel="external">http://devimages.apple.com/iphone/samples/bipbopgear4.html</a></span></p></li><li class="li"><p><span class="content_text"><a href="http://devimages.apple.com/iphone/samples/bipbopall.html" class="urlLink" rel="external">http://devimages.apple.com/iphone/samples/bipbopall.html</a></span></p></li></ul><p>The samples show the same NTSC test pattern at four different resolutions and data rates. The last sample streams at multiple data rates. The stream starts with sample 1 and switches to the fastest sample the connection supports.</p><p>You must install iOS version 3.0 or later to play these samples on your iPhone or iPod touch. QuickTime X is required for playback on the desktop. To view the sample streams in browsers other than Safari, the QuickTime plug-in or ActiveX component is required.</p></section>
